Rover 95 was founded in 2018 as Rasjet, and we're not planning to stop making things any time soon. Some projects are stored in the [Zell EXPRESS FTP](https://zell.vercel.app) or the [Exprite EZ FTP](https://exprite.vercel.app) .

We do not know, what are we doing.
We do extremely random things. Few of them are server hosting for people and a minecraft server + developing random stuff!
